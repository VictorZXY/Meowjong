### Original Aims of the Project

Mahjong is a very popular multiplayer imperfect-information game developed in China in the late 19th-century, with some very challenging features for AI research. In my Part II project, I aimed to build an AI for a reduced, 3-player version of the Japanese Riichi Mahjong, using deep reinforcement learning, and sought to defeat an agent that plays purely randomly. I planned to pre-train 5 deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), each corresponding to one type of action in Riichi Mahjong, and enhance the major action's model, namely the discard model, using self-play reinforcement learning.

### Work Completed

I trained two Mahjong agents using supervised learning (SL), and another agent by improving one of the SL agents using reinforcement learning (RL), with necessary additional modules including data collection and processing, Mahjong hand calculation and a game simulator, for the agents to be trained and evaluated. All agents have passed my pre-set success criteria. In addition, my CNN models have achieved top-tier test accuracies, and the RL agent performed significantly better than both SL agents, suggesting that my project possesses a strong potential to make a contribution to the relevant topic, pending online evaluations against human players.

### Special Difficulties

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was forced to work remotely from home in China for the entire Lent and Easter Terms. The environment at home was not ideal for working, and Internet access was not always reliable. I also had to constantly work in antisocial hours due to a 7/8-hour time difference from the UK. My mental conditions were also seriously affected, because of the significantly reduced opportunities to meet my friends and the strong concerns about not being able to perform up to my true ability academically.
